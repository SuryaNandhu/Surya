#To reduce the impact of natural disaster
  Disasters have adversely affected humans since the dawn of our existence. In response, individuals and
societies alike have made many attempts to decrease their exposure to the consequences of these disasters,
developing measures to address initial impact, as well as post-disaster response and recovery
needs. Regardless of the approach adopted, all of these efforts have the same goal: disaster
management.
  Disasters may be natural or artificial(man made).When disasters occur due to natural forces they are called natural disasters, over which man has hardly any control. Some common natural disasters are earthquakes, landslides floods,etc,..On the other hand Man-made(ie.,Artificial) disasters fall into two categories: terrorism, which is a deliberate, criminal act and accidental disasters involving hazardous materials and stuffs.
  Some of the means for improving the quality and availability of hazard and risk assessments as of me
*the development of computerized multihazard geographic information systems that would make information traditionally stored on paper maps and charts and in books easily accessible to decision-makers,
*research on the physical and biological factors that contribute to and cause natural disasters,
*research on the social factors that govern human response to natural hazards, and
*research on technological and societal strategies for disaster reduction.
